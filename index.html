            Python is a versatile and powerful high-level programming language
            that emphasizes code readability and simplicity. Its clean and
            straightforward syntax allows beginners to quickly grasp programming
            concepts, while also offering advanced features that make it a
            preferred choice for experienced developers.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Python is known for its ability to integrate with other languages
              and tools, making it highly adaptable to various development
              needs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Due to its flexibility, Python has become a popular language in many
            fields, including web development, data science, machine learning,
            artificial intelligence, scientific computing, automation, and
            software development.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Its vast standard library and large community support have helped
              it become one of the most widely used programming languages in the
              world.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
          <header><h1>Hello world</h1></header>
          <p>
            The "Hello, World!" program is a simple script that is often the
            first code written by beginners to learn the basics of a new
            programming language. It is a tradition across the programming
            community to start with this example, as it demonstrates how to
            display output to the user in a straightforward manner.
          </p>
          <p>In Python, it's as simple as writing a single line of code:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>print("Hello, World!")</code>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header><h1>Variables</h1></header>
          <p>
            Variables in Python are used to store information that your program
            can use and manipulate as it runs. They act as containers for data
            values, which can be changed or reused throughout your code.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The beauty of variables in Python is that they are dynamically
              typed, meaning you don't have to explicitly declare their data
              type; Python determines it automatically based on the assigned
              value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In Python, you can create a variable by assigning a value to a name:
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>name = "Abel Gideon"</code>
            <code>age = 21</code>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Control_statements">
          <header><h1>Control statements</h1></header>
          <p>
            Control statements in Python allow you to manage the flow of your
            program based on different conditions. These statements enable
            decision-making, looping, and branching in your code, making it
            possible to perform different actions depending on the circumstances
            or the values of variables.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Control statements are a fundamental aspect of programming as they
              give your code the power to adapt and respond to changing
              situations.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Python supports several control statements like if ... else
            statements and loops.
          </p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>num = 10</code>
            <code>if num > 10:</code>
            <code class="indent">print("Number greater than 10")</code>
            <code>else:</code>
            <code class="indent">print("Number is not greater than 10")</code>
          </div>
          <div class="code">
            <code>num = 1</code>
            <code>while num <= 10:</code>
            <code class="indent">print(num)</code>
            <code class="indent">num += 1</code>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
          <header><h1>Functions</h1></header>
          <p>
            Functions are one of the most essential building blocks in Python.
            They are reusable pieces of code designed to perform a specific
            task, which you can call whenever you need that task to be executed.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Functions help to break down complex problems into smaller, more
              manageable parts, making your code more organized, readable, and
              easier to debug or maintain.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In Python, you can define a function using:</p>
          <div class="code">
            <code>def greet():</code>
            <code class="indent">print("Hey!")</code>
            <br />
            <code>greet()</code>
          </div>
        </section>
      </div>
    </main>
  </body>
